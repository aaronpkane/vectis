# **VECTIS Development Summary**

*A living design document for the development of VECTIS — the universal competency and compliance engine.*

*Contact: aaronpkane@yahoo.com*

---

## **Core Product Thesis (Locked)**

> **VECTIS gives organizations real-time clarity into true capability, while automatically enforcing all compliance requirements through a built-in, inspection-ready training framework.**

This remains the guiding principle of all system architecture and workflow design.

---

# **Design Principles (Non‑Negotiable)**

VECTIS must adhere to the following constraints across all engines and workflows:

### **Neutral Terminology**

No domain‑specific jargon baked into the underlying model.

### **Modular Competency Structure**

Competencies composed of tasks; reusable, flexible, non-prescriptive.

### **Flexible Verification Logic**

Pass/fail or scored evaluations with evidence support.

### **Configurable Roles & Permissions**

RBAC determines access; permissions scoped per unit.

### **Exportable, Integration-Ready Models**

Clean API-ready structures; simple ICS calendar sync for MVP.

### **Universal Readiness & Compliance KPIs**

Accurate, inspection-ready metrics for individuals and units.

### **Compliance Logic = Competency Logic**

Compliance is computed directly from competency recency and evaluation history.

---

# **The 8 Engines of VECTIS**

These engines represent the core logical subsystems of the platform.

## **1. Competency Model Engine**

Defines what capability *is*.

**Tables (MVP):**

* `competencies`
* `tasks`
* `recency_models`
* `competency_recency_policies`
* `role_profiles` (now used as **rate-based templates**)
* `role_profile_competencies`

**Purpose:**

* Define competencies, tasks, default recency rules.
* Define rate-based templates for automatic initial competency assignment.

---

## **2. Compliance & Policy Engine**

Applies rules to determine whether a member is compliant.

* Expiration logic (validity + grace windows)
* Compliance state calculation (current / in-grace / expired)
* Inspection-ready outputs

---

## **3. Identity, Roles & Org Graph Engine**

Responsible for:

* Users (members, instructors, training managers, admins)
* Unit structure
* Rate-based role profiles
* **Member competency assignments** (unit-specific requirements)

**Upcoming tables:**

* `users`
* `org_units`
* `user_org_memberships`
* `member_competency_assignments`

---

## **4. Evidence & Verification Engine**

Captures:

* Evaluations (pass/fail/score)
* Evidence uploads
* Verification/sign-off trails

---

## **5. Readiness, KPIs & Analytics Engine**

Provides visibility:

* Individual readiness
* Unit readiness
* Role coverage
* Mission progress
* Compliance risk

---

## **6. Workflow & Events Engine**

Automation layer:

* Expiration reminders
* Evaluation reminders
* Mission deadlines
* Notification triggers

---

## **7. Integration & Data Layer**

MVP integrations:

* ICS-based calendar sync
* Export/Import (CSV)
* Clean API boundaries for the future

---

## **8. Training Mission Engine**

A structured campaign engine for delivering competency-driven training.

**Mission Structure:**

* mission_id
* competency_id(s)
* rate-profile‑based participant assignment
* events
* instructors
* mission status

**Event Structure:**

* event_id
* mission_id
* task linkage
* attendance tracking
* evaluation requirements

---

# **Daily Workflow: Training Manager Perspective**

1. View unit readiness dashboard.
2. Process expirations & required evaluations.
3. Launch missions and events.
4. Approve evaluations & review evidence.
5. Export compliance/readiness reports.

---

# **MVP USERS (Locked)**

### **System Admin**

* Seeds competency catalog and rate templates
* Creates unit(s)
* Assigns Unit Admins

### **Unit Admin**

* Manages members
* Assigns rate (role_profile)
* Manages instructor permissions
* Read-only access to readiness/compliance

### **Training Manager**

* Creates/launches missions
* Builds events
* Approves evaluations
* Oversees member competency assignments
* Produces readiness & compliance reports

### **Instructor**

* Conducts events
* Marks attendance
* Submits evaluations & evidence

### **Member**

* Views training schedule
* Views qualification status
* Receives notifications

---

# **MVP CAPABILITIES (Locked)**

### **Backend Architecture**

* PostgreSQL relational schema
* All engines modularized
* Audit logging foundation
* Transaction-safe evaluation updates
* Background workers for workflow

### **RBAC Security**

* Strict role separation
* Unit-scoped permissions
* JWT auth + refresh
* Enforcement at API & UI

### **Competency Engine**

* CRUD for competencies, tasks, recency
* Rate-based templates via role_profiles
* Automatic assignment seeding when a member joins a unit

### **Training Missions**

* Mission creation, event planning
* Instructor & member assignment
* Launch workflow
* ICS calendar sync

### **Evaluations & Evidence**

* Pass/fail/score
* Evidence upload
* Verification workflow

### **Readiness & Compliance**

* Recency-driven compliance states
* Mission progress
* Unit readiness
* Exportable reports

### **Workflow Engine**

* Expiration alerts
* Evaluation reminders
* Mission deadlines

### **UI/UX Requirements**

* Clean dashboard
* Instructor event workflow
* Member self-service view
* Responsive, professional interface

---

# **MVP NON-GOALS (Locked)**

* No multi-unit enterprise support
* No deep MS Graph integration (ICS only)
* No mobile app
* No curriculum builder
* No instructor-certification logic
* No multi-org analytics
* No drag-and-drop editors
* No LMS-style content delivery

---

# **Completed So Far**

* Full system thesis
* 8-engine architecture
* MVP scope (users, capabilities, non-goals)
* Competency Model Engine schema
* PostgreSQL environment initialized
* Competency tables created in database
* Decision on rate-based templates retained (`role_profiles`)
* Future-proof design for transfers & career history

---

# **Next Steps**

### **1. Build the Identity & Assignment Engine (v1):**

* `users`
* `org_units`
* `user_org_memberships`
* `member_competency_assignments`

### **2. Implement logic:**

* New user onboarding → assign rate → auto-seed competency assignments
* Assignment editor for Training Managers

### **3. Then proceed to:**

* Training Missions Engine schema
* Events + evaluations
* Compliance + readiness calculations

This document will continue evolving as VECTIS progresses from schema → logic → interface → deployment.
